PREFATORY NOTE 



The art of Edgar Hilaire Germain Degas is full of paradoxes. He consciously 
sought out objects ordinarily thought lacking in significance or that are assumed 
unfit for graphic representation. This practice demonstrates that a great artist can 
produce distinguished works from the commonplace things rejected or undreamed 
of by minor men. Let no one think this habit of mind arose from the desire to be 
merely different or to startle. He saw the commonplace and the vulgar to be Life; 
and Life was his preoccupation. The result is an exuberant reality unsurpassed in 
the nineteenth century. He reverently copied many of the Old Masters and thus 
emphasized his respect for sound precedent. Perhaps it is that self-training which 
accounts for the dignity of his representations no matter how commonplace or 
vulgar his models might be. The draughtsmanship that he achieved displays firm 
contours combined with what the French term "sensibilite," which we look for in 
vain among his contemporaries. In many a wistful drawing one is baffled by the 
ingenuity of the artist who, with such economy of means, can render the French 
charm and repose which set their inevitable stamp of time, place, station and 
nationality upon the sitter. Further than that, every kind of human gesture and 
movement is depicted with intense emotion — those subtle gestures and movements 
which best reflect the ingrained daily habits, postures and labors of his varied models. 
Again and again we are fascinated by the animated gestures of well-constructed 
arms and hands; by the skillful poise of bodies; above all by the palpitating vitality 
of the figures. 

If such enthusiastic comments as these have validity, proof of them will be found 
in the present notable exhibition. As a student and as a collector of the art of France 
I have long held the view that, in spite of the vagaries of Paris fashion, Degas is the 
most sensitive as well as one of the greatest artists of the nineteenth century. I hold 
this opinion because of the exquisite harmony of his color; because of his superb 
capacity as a draughtsman; because of the magic way in which he combines linear 
rhythm with solid modelling; because of his mastery of design, and lastly, because 
of that vital imagination which visualizes the inner, higher, truth. 

It is not my intention, however, in this prefatory note, to write a critical or 
biographical essay. I delight, rather, to be associated with this memorable enterprise 



[ 5 ] 



because of my long and profound interest in the work of Degas, as evidenced by my 
own collection, and because of the joy that every teacher must feel to see his pupils 
carrying on with sympathy and understanding his own enthusiasms. 

I may add also that I find it peculiarly fitting that this largest loan exhibition 
of the master's works should be shown in the native state of his only pupil, Mary 
Cassatt. Degas was the only one of the great French painters of the nineteenth 
century to pay a visit to the United States. He was the only one who had relatives 
and interests in the United States. His work has always been received here with well 
deserved enthusiasm and with true appreciation. And those who are fortunate 
enough to see the exhibiton itself, or failing that to keep this catalogue as a perma- 
nent record, will be grateful to the many public institutions and private collectors 
in Europe and America who have cooperated with such generosity.

INTRODUCTION 



"V totality, veracity, variety — these three are the dominating and constant qualities 
* in all of Degas' work. Line and form, light and color, movement and repose, 
perception and mood — all possess a mysterious and vibrant life, a new but quickly rec- 
ognized truth and a surprising and delightful freshness. Whether exploring new 
fields or following a long tradition, whether practicing with a new medium or, in 
a familiar medium, playing variations on a favorite theme, Degas always discovered 
some new harmony of movement or color, some novel subtlety of light, or some 
different facet of character. His was an acute and piercing vision, original, uncompro- 
mising and tireless; a discerning and disciplined intelligence, cultivated, inquiring 
and penetrating; and a trained and exacting hand — graceful, experimental and 
indefatigable. His own capacities he knew and estimated with justness and without 
pretensions. His famed intolerance was directed only against the hackneyed, the 
superficial and the insincere. The storms of protest and the crackling diatribes 
directed against some of his work, he dismissed with a shrug. Both long since proved 
boomerangs, demolishing the critical reputations of those who launched them. 

In the finest sense of the word Degas was an aristocrat undeviating from his own 
high standards, aloof from the contamination of the mediocre. Because he was a 
creative genius these standards were never arid, frozen or rigid, but living, flowering 
and changing. The firm fibres upon which they were strung were artistic excellence 
and absolute integrity. From the outset his way was clear before him. The youth of 
twenty-one who in 1855 abandoned the study of law, first to study at the Ecole des 
Beaux Arts and in the studio of Lamothe and then by himself in Italy, took the step 
with a surety of will which should have allayed any family misgivings. The blessing 
which his father (a Paris banker with artistic leanings of his own, evidenced by his 
love of music) at once gave his son, took the form of an allowance which made 
Degas financially independent and able for the rest of his life to give all his time 
and energies without worry or distraction to his chosen work. The final wealth of 
his artistic production, its diversity, its originality and its excellence more than 
justified the confidence of his father. 

The present exhibition, assembled from the private and public collections in Europe 
and the United States, abundantly illustrates the long rich development of Degas' 



[ 7 ] 



art. Here he can be studied as a draughtsman, as a painter, as a pastellist, as a print- 
maker and, in one notable example, as a sculptor. He appears as a witty and yet 
obviously enchanted commentator upon feminine fashions — The Millinery Shop 
(No. 40) and Young Woman in Street Costume (No. 76), as a dramatic illustrator 
of a current literary subject — Interior (No. 23); as the accurate and sympathetic 
recorder of his contemporary artists — Manet (Nos. 65, 66, 67) and Diego Martelli 
(Nos. 30 and 82); and as the graphic historian of Parisian operatic and music hall 
stages. He can be seen experimenting with new media and new measures: oil sketches 
on various colored papers, uniquely large and ambitious pastels, monotypes and 
color prints. One recognizes the new artistic currents of his time as he uses the 
camera and the camera point-of-view; or as he adopts in his own compositions 
certain color harmonies, steep foreshortenings and asymmetrical designs suggested 
by the study of Japanese prints. 

He has long been familiar to the American public as the painter of jockeys and 
race courses, ballet dancers, and women at their toilettes. He has been too little 
known here as a draughtsman and portrait painter. Too proud to show, too independ- 
ent to sell the vast quantities of his drawings and the majority of his portraits, he 
kept them in his studio until his death. 

Beyond cavil, Degas was the most distinguished draughtsman of his century. 
Enlightened and disciplined by his study of the Quattrocento Italians, of Clouet and 
Holbein, a study which he carried to the extent of making faithful copies, he early 
developed a fastidious, fresh and sensitive line — as fine as the line of Ingres, whom 
he deeply admired, but at once more casual and more evocative. During the sixties, 
when by countless preparatory sketches he clarified every detail of pose and composi- 
tion before venturing further to oil and canvas, the surety and rhythm of his line 
developed. Several figure drawings lent by the Musee du Louvre are beautiful 
examples of his early manner. Two of these delicate yet unfaltering studies are for 
the same figure in the large painting Semiramis of 1861 (Nos. 60 and 61). One is nude, 
the other draped. Both have a unique quality of youth and freshness: the first with 
a Florentine sense of form, the second with an almost Greek crispness of drapery. 
Out of this fine, graceful line there came the full decisive strokes of his maturity, 
defining form with a sculptural breadth and firmness and magically suggesting 
space and atmosphere: Dancers at the Bar (No. 80). 

As he advanced in years and, slowly, in blindness, rich crayons and pastels 
replaced the pencil, fuller forms; more daring compositions and wonderful texture 



C8 ] 



supplanted the restrained, traditional and often sombre elegance of his early work. 
The change can be followed as clearly in the portraits as in the drawings. His own 
youthful Self Portrait (No. 58) with the intense, serious and self-appraising eyes, 
and the early family portraits such as that of his brother Achille (No. 3) and of 
his sister and her husband the Duke and Duchess of Morbilli (No. 10) are restrained, 
sober and distinguished. They all show already the dominant characteristic of his 
portraiture: an accent on the revealing glance and the individual gesture. As his 
technique and his color heightened so did his content. That which had been an 
undercurrent of emotion and vitality, showing in little more than the eyes or the 
pose of a hand, gradually assumed dominant power, so that even the character of a 
room, such as the one where Diego Martelli sits, bears the stamp of the sitter's 
personality. 

This power to create an atmosphere which has not only individuality but vibrance 
and depth, is Degas' unique endowment linked with his power to depict movement. 
The sparkling light on a race field, the humid and heavy atmosphere of laundries, 
the magic and transforming artificial light of the stage, the almost palpable air of 
curtained French interiors — each is as individual and as important as the straining 
tension of the racing horse, the tired pressing of the laundress, the trained and airy 
movements of the ballet dancer and the full and bourgeois gestures of the bathing 
women. It is this happy marriage of movement and atmosphere which gives to 
Degas' work its astonishing vitality. One might think only a camera could catch 
such transient movements, but in comparison a snapshot is spiritless and barren, 
never achieving a comparable degree of life or color or air. 

It is impossible to label with a single tag such a diverse talent. He has been called 
with justness the most Parisian of nineteenth century painters — and yet he was the 
most travelled, for he visited not only Italy (countless times) and the United States, 
but England, Holland, Germany, Spain and many provinces of his own France. 
He is neither a classicist, a romanticist nor a realist — and yet he is all three. Possibly 
this can be partially explained by the mixture of races which ran in his veins, the 
aristocratic French of the Orleans "de Gas," the colorful and generous Neapolitan 
of his paternal grandmother and the adventurous Creole of his New Orleans mother. 
More probably, however, it is due to his own conscious artistic descent. He often 
practised the classic qualities of careful construction, clear design, fine detachment 
and intrinsic elegance, yet he was equally possessed of a romantic's love of rich and 
arbitrary color, dramatic light and shadow, the exciting and the unexpected. As a 



[9 ] 



realist he accepted the everyday, disdained the artificial and acknowledged the ugly. 
In simple purity and absolute beauty the small Head of a Young Woman (No. 11) from 
the Louvre seems the creation of art as serene as Vermeer's. In profusion of color 
and confusion of movement the large Jephthah's Daughter (No. 7) seems to come 
from a spirit as imaginative and extravagant as Delacroix's. In brilliant originality 
of subject matter and daring composition The Cotton Market in New Orleans (No. 20) 
is the founder of a new era. 

It is this fusion of the best which tradition can offer with a new and vital vision 
and spirit which makes of Degas the last of the old masters and the first of the new.

NOTE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT 



/Tpo the owners of works by Degas goes the Museum's first and greatest gratitude. 
¦*¦ Whether in Europe or America, they have shown unfailing generosity and kind- 
ness. The sacrifice involved in sending their paintings and drawings to Philadelphia 
has been great, and the Museum is greatly appreciative. The list of those whose 
works are included follows this note. 

Special acknowledgments are due to Mrs. John D. Mcllhenny, an admirer of 
the art of Degas, who has made possible this exhibition, and to Mr. Paul J. Sachs, 
author of the prefatory note, my friend and master, distinguished collector of the 
artist's works. His advice, his help and his encouragement have been invaluable. 

The Musee du Louvre, learning of the Pennsylvania Museum's initiative, graciously 
postponed until 1937 the Degas exhibition to have been held in Paris at the period 
of ours. This friendly gesture on the part of M. Henri Verne, Directeur des Musees 
Nationaux, has permitted the inclusion of pictures and drawings from France which 
otherwise would not have been available at this time. 

In the preparation of the catalogue, M. P. -A. Lemoisne, Conservateur du Cabinet 
des Estampes at the Bibliotheque Nationale, acting in cooperation with M. Georges 
Wildenstein, Director of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, has been of the most generous 
assistance. M. Lemoisne, already the author of a standard work on the master, has 
freely put at our disposal the manuscript material for his forthcoming catalogue 
raisonne of Degas paintings and pastels. In general, the dating of the works here 
given follows the data of M. Lemoisne, although the opinions of the owners of the 
paintings have been respected. The many kindnesses of M. Lemoisne, of M. Wilden- 
stein, and of Mile. Assia Rubinstein are deeply valued. The catalogue information 
for the drawings of the Sachs collection, as well as the introduction, have been 
graciously supplied by Miss Agnes Mongan. Many other persons, both in Europe and 
America, have been of material aid in the organization of this exhibition. To them 
go the Museum's warmest thanks:
